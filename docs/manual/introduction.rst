Introduction
============
This library is a set of tool to treat results from CST and SPARK3D.
All illustrations shown below are produced with the scripts from the :doc:`examples` section.


Compute exponential growth factors
**********************************
From SPARK3D

.. note::
   Easy study of the influence of other parameters, such as number of seed electrons in this example.

Treat CST's position monitor data
